# Wynncraft-Lootrun-Bot-Experimental
A very experimental version of Lootrun bot in wynncraft
- Will not work without very specific conditions and a very specific resource pack
- For my personal use
- Project development suspended until I learn how to make a hack client.

How it works:
- User hard-codes the list of coordinates
- OCR gets coordinates off your screen (use F3)
- Calculates the distance and how much you need to rotate
- Walks to the destination
